# Daily Brief - Canonical Pull Spec

Reference for the refresh mechanism (Option A: agent-orchestrated). Claude, in-session, is the refresh runtime. The app stays static: no runtime fetch, no standing credentials. Each refresh re-pulls live data for the **present day**, transforms it to the module's `data.js` shape, writes the file, and verifies the preview.

This spec is the source of truth for the per-module generators and for the single refresh skill, `briefing-daily`. Any structural change to a `gen-*.mjs`, a payload shape, or a module's data schema must update this file in the same commit - the skill and the repo are a synchronised pair.

There is no token-based path. `scripts/refresh-perf.mjs` was deleted: it hardcoded a retired quota and wrote `data.js` directly, bypassing every gate below. No token is stored, no script runs unattended, Claude drives every pull through approved connectors.

## Identity and shared constants

Per-operator values are **not written here**. They live in `src/config.js`
(gitignored, created from `src/config.example.js` at install) and, for the
refresh runtime, in `~/.claude/skills/briefing-daily/config.local.json`. Read
them from there; never inline an owner id into a query.

- Owner: `PROFILE.name`
- `hubspot_owner_id` = `PROFILE.ownerId`
- Email: `PROFILE.email`
- HubSpot portal = 6195055 (shared)
- Contact-record URL: `https://app.hubspot.com/contacts/6195055/record/0-1/{hsObjectId}`
- Deal-record URL: `https://app.hubspot.com/contacts/6195055/record/0-2/{dealId}`

## Refresh scope and cadence

Wraps **modules 02 (Today), 04 (Performance), 05 (Self-Served), 06 (SDR Pacing), 07 (Deals)** at the trigger.

**Cadence: 09:00, 11:00, 13:00, 15:00, 17:00 CET, Mon-Fri.** The 09:00 slot is a **full run** (02, then 04, then 05, then 06, then 07). Every later slot is a **module 02 top-up**: 02 only, 04/05/06/07 untouched. Meetings get booked into the current day after the morning brief is written, so a once-a-day 02 is structurally behind by lunchtime; 04/05 are YTD and 90-day trend series that do not move five times a day. 17:00 is the last slot - a call booked after 18:00 CET is not a same-day call, so the next 09:00 run serves it.

Run type is read off `src/modules/briefing/data.js`: `TODAY_ISO` already equal to today means a full run landed today, so this is a top-up; `TODAY_ISO` older than today means full run. A manual trigger with no instruction defaults to a full run.

| Module | id | Sources | Pull discipline |
|--------|-----|---------|-----------------|
| 02 Today / Schedule | `briefing` | Google Calendar + HubSpot + Gmail | calendar via browser, HubSpot per-contact lookup, Gmail via browser |
| 04 Performance | `performance` | HubSpot | `/hs` (server-side GROUP BY aggregation) |
| 05 Self-Served | `selfserved` | HubSpot | `/hs` + per-contact deal-association check |
| 06 SDR Pacing | `pacing` | HubSpot | `/hs` (per-SDR SQL/SQO aggregation) |
| 07 Deals | `deals` | HubSpot | `search_crm_objects` (deal-level pull + enrichment) |

**Order is a hard gate, not a preference.** `briefing/data.js` must be written and verified by `gen-briefing.mjs` before the first module 04 or 05 query is issued. Module 02 briefs calls happening within hours; 04 and 05 are trend data that tolerate a day of staleness. A run that burns its first stretch on YTD aggregations and then dies has failed at the only thing that could not wait. A failed 02 therefore stops the run; a failed 04 continues to 05. Modules 06 and 07 run after 05, in that order. A failed 06 continues to 07.

The other two modules pull nothing: 01 Dashboard derives its alert ladder and tiles from the other modules' `data.js` already on disk, 03 Calculator is pure client-side computation. Neither has a generator. Pre-Call SE now lives outside this app (`cloudtalk-precall-se/`, entered via the `pcb-cloudtalk` skill); Competitor and Coach were removed.

## `/hs` discipline (modules 04, 05 and 06)

- Call `tool_guidance` once before the first `query_crm_data` of a run.
- Aggregate **server-side** with `GROUP BY` + `COUNT(*)` / `SUM(...)`. Never pull rows and count client-side - that path undercounts (see CLAUDE.md memory).
- Supported: `DATE_TRUNC`, `COUNT(*)`, `SUM`, `GROUP BY`, `BETWEEN`, cross-object `OBJECT.property`.
- Not supported: `DISTINCT`, `CASE`, column aliases, `JOIN`, `HAVING`.

### One query per metric, spanning the whole window

Each metric is **one** aggregation covering every month at once - `GROUP BY <dimension>, DATE_TRUNC('month', <date>)` with a single `BETWEEN` over the full window. Never loop a query per month.

A per-month loop returns byte-identical output at 8x the round-trips, and nothing downstream would catch it: the reconciliation gates check arithmetic, not how the numbers were fetched. This rule is the only thing standing between a 25-call run and a 200-call one. The geo-matrix example below is the canonical shape - copy its structure for every metric.

### Parallelize the aggregations

The module 04 metrics have no interdependencies. Issue them in parallel batches (4-6 concurrent; HubSpot's per-portal concurrency limit is not documented here, so stay conservative rather than discovering it mid-run) instead of one at a time. A run is latency-bound on round-trips, not on HubSpot's aggregation work.

This is a correctness measure as much as a speed one. `gen-performance.mjs` documents a known MQL drift whose stated cause is two counts "pulled moments apart" - independent `COUNT`s against a moving pipeline. Compressing the pull into a tight window shrinks that skew. A snapshot should be a snapshot.

Exception: the Step 0 preflight stays strictly sequential. Its purpose is attributing a stall to a specific connector, which parallel calls destroy.

---

## Module 02 - Today / Schedule

File: `src/modules/briefing/data.js`. Component (`BriefingModule.jsx`) is never touched by a refresh.

### What gets regenerated each run

- Date constants: `TODAY_ISO`, `TODAY_LABEL`, `REFRESHED_AT`, `WEEK_DAYS` (Mon-Fri of the current week - working week only, no weekend columns). Derived from `src/lib/dates.js`; never hand-typed.
- `WEEK_PROSPECTS[TODAY_ISO]` = array of prospect cards for today, fully regenerated (facts + prose).
- `WEEK_OTHER_EVENTS[TODAY_ISO]` = array of non-meeting calendar blocks for today.
- **Intraweek pull, every run.** The calendar pull covers the whole current week (the `weekDays(TODAY_ISO)` Mon-Fri set), not just today. Future days of this week get their cards created or updated from the fresh calendar - a meeting booked Wednesday for Friday must appear on Wednesday, not on Friday morning. Days of the current week that have already elapsed are carried forward verbatim. Days with nothing on them stay `[]`; the generator requires all five week keys present.
- Enrichment depth is graded by day, deliberately. Today's cards get the full treatment (exhaustive HubSpot + Gmail + Lusha + fresh prose, all the gates below). Future-day cards need the calendar facts and the HubSpot join at minimum; their prose is regenerated in full on the morning they become today.
- Historical week arrays (`LAST_WEEK_PROSPECTS`, `TWO_WEEKS_AGO_PROSPECTS`) are **not** refreshed - they are frozen history, rolled by `gen-briefing.mjs` itself on a Monday change.

### Step 1 - Calendar (browser)

Use `Claude_in_Chrome` (`tabs_context_mcp` -> `navigate` to Google Calendar -> `get_page_text`). `Control_Chrome` is unreliable in this environment (read/exec fail with "Chrome not running"); prefer Claude_in_Chrome.

**Week view, not day view.** One pull of the current week covers today and the intraweek days above at the same cost as a day view. Read today's slice off it for the cards, and the Tue-Fri columns for the forward days.

Per event extract: attendee display name + email, `start`, `end` (HH:MM), **meeting link**, RSVP status, canceled flag. Classify each event:

- Has an external attendee / is a prospect call -> prospect card.
- Personal / internal block (gym, lunch, AFK, sport) -> other event.

**Meeting links are not HubSpot-scoped.** Pull the join link for *every* event that has one, whatever its provider and whoever created it - Google Meet, Zoom, Teams, Whereby, a raw dial-in URL in the location field or pasted in the description. Do not restrict this to HubSpot-booked meetings, and do not drop the link just because the event classified as an "other event": an internal sync or a partner call is exactly the kind of block where a one-click join is the whole point.

This holds for **every invite in the intraweek pull**, not only today's: a forward-day card without its join link forces a calendar hunt at the moment the call starts, which is the one moment there is no time for it.

Both classifications carry it under the same key, `meetLink`, so the UI needs no branch. Look in this order: the event's conferencing entry, then `location`, then the first URL in the description. No link found -> `meetLink: null`, never a guessed or reconstructed URL.

### Step 2 - HubSpot enrichment (per attendee)

For each prospect attendee email, look up the contact (`search_crm_objects` on contacts by `email`). Single-record lookups are fine via raw MCP; the `/hs` aggregation rule applies only to counts. Pull:

`firstname`, `lastname`, `company` (+ company domain for `companyUrl`), `jobtitle`, `country`, `hs_lead_status` (-> `leadStatus`), `lead_source` (-> `leadSource`), associated deal count (-> `deals`), `seat_range` (-> `seats`), `phone`.

**Exhaustive search, per lead.** One email lookup is the start of the search, not the whole of it. If the email misses, or returns a record with the wanted properties empty, search again: by `firstname + lastname`, by company name, by the email's domain against company records, and check the contact's associated company for firmographics the contact record does not carry. Only after those miss is the field genuinely absent.

`country` is the field this rule exists for. It drives the Gmail draft language (Step 3), so a null country does not degrade gracefully - it ships an English draft to a French prospect and nothing in the app flags it. Chase it on the contact, then the associated company, then the phone country code as a last resort (recorded as an inference in `dataGaps`, never written as if pulled).

A property the record genuinely does not hold is `null` **and** an entry in `dataGaps`. A property that was not looked for is a defect, not a gap.

Ambiguity rule: if the calendar gives only a first name and HubSpot returns multiple matches, pick the best candidate, **flag the assumption** in `companyBrief`, and add a "confirm who is on the call" qualifier. Never silently guess.

### Step 3 - Gmail (browser)

Last email thread with the attendee -> `lastEmail` (subject + date + 1-line gist). If Gmail is not reachable this run, set `lastEmail: null` (the card render guards on null). Do not block the refresh on Gmail.

**Draft language.** The card's Gmail button opens a pre-filled "I'm on the call, are you joining?" draft. It is localised off the contact's `country`: **Spain -> Spanish, France -> French, everything else -> English.** Copy is written natively per language (FR vouvoiement and French question/colon spacing; ES tuteo, the norm in Spanish B2B SaaS), not machine-translated from the English.

This keys on **country, not on the card's sales region**. The regions would mistranslate - Portugal is region `ES` without being Spanish-speaking, Morocco and Belgium are region `FR`. English is the deliberate fallback for every other country: a machine-translated Dutch or Italian draft reads worse than a clean English one.

The copy lives in `DRAFT_COPY` in `BriefingModule.jsx` (component-side, not generated), so a refresh only needs to pull `country` correctly in Step 2 - it never writes email copy into `data.js`.

### Step 3b - Lusha enrichment (always run, every card, carryover and new)

For every prospect card - not just newly-enriched ones - run Lusha: `contacts_search` by email first, then by `first_name + last_name + company_name` if the email lookup 404s, then fall back to `companies_search` by domain for company-level firmographics if no contact match exists (e.g. shared inboxes, unindexed small companies). Populate the card's `lusha` object (verified, title, seniority, department, linkedin, personLocation, companyLegalName, headcount, headcountBand, industry, subIndustry, founded, hq, businessModel, linkedinFollowers, mainLine, teamShape, seniorityShape, competitors, itSpend, funding, signals, industryContext, dataGaps) with whatever Lusha returns; fields with no data stay `null`/`[]`, never fabricated. If both contact and company lookups miss, leave `lusha: null` but say so explicitly in `dataGaps`/`companyBrief` rather than silently skipping the attempt.

Feed Lusha firmographics into `qualifierQuestions` and `companyBrief` where it sharpens discovery - e.g. a large multinational contact should get a scope/authority-check question (is this team-scoped or enterprise-wide?), a small team gets different questions than a 10,000+ employee company.

**Known limitation (2026-10-28): no Lusha MCP tool exists in this environment.** There is no `contacts_search`, `companies_search`, or any Lusha-prefixed tool in the available MCP connectors. Until a Lusha MCP server is provisioned, every card will have `lusha: null`. This is an infrastructure constraint, not a per-run transient failure, so it must NOT be declared as a per-card dataGap on every run. Instead: set `lusha: null` silently and note "Lusha enrichment unavailable (no MCP connector)" once in the module-level prose or run report, not per card. The `companyBrief` may mention the absence when it materially affects qualification, but the `dataGaps` array on each card should not carry a Lusha entry - it creates noise that drowns real gaps.

### Output shape

Prospect card:

```js
{ name, email, start, end,
  hsLink: HS(id), meetLink, canceled, rsvp,
  company, companyUrl, jobtitle, country,
  leadStatus, leadSource, deals, seats, phone, multiAttendee,
  companyBrief, challengerInsight,
  qualifierQuestions: [{ key, label, hint }],
  lastEmail }
```

Other event: `{ emoji, name, start, end, color, note?, meetLink? }`.

`meetLink` on an other event is rendered as a join button by `BriefingModule.jsx` (Meet and Zoom are labelled distinctly, anything else falls back to a generic join). Omit the key or set it `null` when the event has no link.

`HS(id)` is defined locally in `data.js` (full contact URL, no `OWNER` dependency).

### Determinism vs generated prose

- Deterministic (pulled facts): everything except the three prose fields.
- Generated per run: `companyBrief`, `challengerInsight`, `qualifierQuestions`. These are Claude-authored from the pulled facts. Regenerate them each run from the fresh data; do not carry stale prose forward.

### PII handling

Names, emails, phones are pulled. They live in `data.js` for the **local dashboard only**. Never write them to logs, summaries, memory, or any external system. PII use here is pre-authorized for the local build (CLAUDE.md memory) and nowhere else.

## Module 04 - Performance

File: `src/modules/performance/data.js`. Single export `PERFORMANCE`. All counts via `/hs` GROUP BY.

### Metric definitions (deal-based, matched to portal reports)

- **SQL** = deals the operator created: `deal_creator__sdr_only_` = `<ownerId>`, bucketed by deal `createdate`.
- **SQO** = SQLs accepted by an AE: + `deal_accepted_by_ae` = true.
- **Rejected** = `deal_accepted_by_ae` = `false` (string literal, not `No`), bucketed by `rejected_deal_timestamp`.
- **Points** = `deal_sdr_points_number` (seats_points + va_point). 90 pts/month = 100% = EUR 1,933.33; 1 pt = EUR 21.48. Quota was raised from 80 to 90 on 2026-07-22 - `scripts/gen-performance.mjs` and `performance/data.js` already carry 90; do not reintroduce 80. Credited in the month the deal is **accepted** (`accepted_deal__date_time_`), not created.
- **AI deal** = `va_point` >= 1.
- **Seat tier** (`discovery_call__seats`): micro 1-10, senior_micro 11-20, smb 21-50, mm 51-100, enterprise 101+.
- **MRR segment** (`amount__products_recurring`): micro <= 500, smb 500-1500, midmarket >= 1500. **Query by BETWEEN filter per tier, not GROUP BY** - see the segment query pattern below.
- **Won** = dealstage 6607659 (Won / Implementation - Inbound Pipeline).
- **Value** = `SUM(amount_in_home_currency)` (EUR). **Geo** = deal-level `country`.

### Sections to regenerate (keys of `PERFORMANCE`)

- `refreshedAt`, `weekLabel`, `monthLabel`, `pacing.today` / `dayOfMonth` / `daysInMonth` / `earned`.
- `points[]`, `acceptance`, `acceptanceByMonth[]` + `acceptanceYtd`, `sqoToWonByMonth[]` + `sqoToWonYtd`.
- `stalls[]` (SQLs still pending an AE decision; rendered by module 07's qualified-no-decision lane, which filters to the current month - a pre-month stall pays no commission and is never shown).
- `funnel` (MQL by month; SQL/SQO/rejected/pending + value by seat tier by month; AI vs core by month).
- `metrics` (week + month headline), `mqlToSql`, `progression[]`.
- `rejectedByOwner[]`, `mqlGeo[]` + `mqlGeoTotal`, `segmentSplit`, `segmentMonthly[]`, `geo[]` + `geoTotal`.
- `mqlYtdDrift` - **required number.** `funnel.mql.ytd` minus the sum of the monthly MQL buckets. Declare it even when it is `0`. MQL YTD is its own distinct-contact `COUNT`, not a decomposition of the months, so a small drift is expected and must not abort the run - but it must not be invisible either. `gen-performance.mjs` checks the declared value for exactness, then lets the run through, and `src/lib/freshness.js` renders any non-zero drift in the Shell's amber GAPS banner. This replaces a `console.warn` that nobody reads on an unattended run.
- `dataGaps` - **required array of strings**, empty when there are none. The home for anything the run declared rather than filled: a connector that did not answer, a field HubSpot returned null for, a count pulled at a different moment. Also rendered in the GAPS banner. Empty must be an explicit `[]` so "no gaps" is a statement, not an omission.
- **Geo matrix** `byCountry`: `{ [country]: [{ month, label, mql, sql, sqo, rejected }] }` for each funnel month. This is the live geo re-pull the full-refresh standing instruction requires every run. Drive it from three GROUP BY queries (country x DATE_TRUNC month) for SQL, SQO, Rejected, plus the MQL contact count by country.

### Query pattern (geo matrix example)

One aggregation per metric, grouped by country and month:

```
SELECT country, DATE_TRUNC('month', createdate) AS m, COUNT(*)
FROM deals
WHERE deal_creator__sdr_only_ = <ownerId>
  AND createdate BETWEEN <window_start> AND <window_end>
GROUP BY country, m
```

(Aliases are not supported - express the month bucket inline per the live tool's accepted syntax.) Repeat with `+ deal_accepted_by_ae = true` for SQO and the rejected filter for Rejected. MQL is a contact-level count by `country`.

### Segment query pattern (segmentSplit + segmentMonthly)

**Do not GROUP BY `amount__products_recurring`.** That produces one row per distinct amount value, which exceeds HubSpot's dataset row limit and causes the query to fail or return truncated results. This is a recurring failure - the "segmentSplit carried forward" dataGap.

Instead, run one query per tier per stage, using BETWEEN to bucket by amount range. Six queries for segmentSplit (3 tiers x 2 stages) plus six for segmentMonthly (same, with DATE_TRUNC month added). All twelve can run in the same parallel batch since they have no interdependencies.

**SQL micro (amount <= 500):**
```
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', createdate), COUNT(*), SUM(amount_in_home_currency)
FROM deals
WHERE deal_creator__sdr_only_ = <ownerId>
  AND createdate BETWEEN <window_start> AND <window_end>
  AND amount__products_recurring BETWEEN 0 AND 500
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', createdate)
```

**SQL smb (amount 500-1500):**
```
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', createdate), COUNT(*), SUM(amount_in_home_currency)
FROM deals
WHERE deal_creator__sdr_only_ = <ownerId>
  AND createdate BETWEEN <window_start> AND <window_end>
  AND amount__products_recurring BETWEEN 500.01 AND 1500
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', createdate)
```

**SQL midmarket (amount >= 1500):**
```
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', createdate), COUNT(*), SUM(amount_in_home_currency)
FROM deals
WHERE deal_creator__sdr_only_ = <ownerId>
  AND createdate BETWEEN <window_start> AND <window_end>
  AND amount__products_recurring >= 1500
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', createdate)
```

Repeat each with `+ deal_accepted_by_ae = 'true'` and `accepted_deal__date_time_` as the date dimension for SQO. The `segmentSplit` YTD totals are the sum across all months from each query. `segmentMonthly` is the per-month breakdown directly.

For deals where `amount__products_recurring` is null: these are excluded from all three tiers and are not counted in the segment breakdown. This is intentional - a deal with no recurring amount has no MRR tier.

---

## Module 05 - Self-Served

File: `src/modules/selfserved/data.js`. Single export `SELFSERVED` (+ `onboardingAlertCount`). Rolling 90-day window ending today.

### Cohort (all must hold)

- `hubspot_owner_id` = `<ownerId>`
- `hs_lead_status` NOT IN ('Qualified', 'ATTEMPTED_TO_CONTACT') - both are excluded up front.
  `ATTEMPTED_TO_CONTACT` means "Qualified Out" in this account's lead-status model
  (see CLAUDE.md memory: never filter *for*/pull this status as an open cohort) and
  is treated as functionally equivalent to `Qualified` for this cohort - it must never
  surface as an eligible or non-qualified-open Self-Served candidate.
- `account_became_active` within the rolling 90-day window
- contact has **zero open** and **zero closed-won** deals (closed-lost is allowed -> flagged RE-ENGAGE)

Eligibility judged on contact-level deal association (`associations.DEAL`).

### Funnel (drives the top strip)

`activeInWindow` -> `qualified` (excluded) -> `nonQualified` -> `disqualifiedByDeal` (closed-won, excluded) -> `closedLostReengage` (kept, flagged) -> `noDeal` (clean) -> `eligible` (clean + closed-lost).

### Ranking

`rank_score = round(seat*0.40 + geo*0.35 + source*0.25)`. Tier -> score: T1=100, T2=66, T3=33. Sort desc; ties by `account_became_active` desc (newest activation first).

### Item shape

```js
{ hsObjectId, self_served, hsLink,
  firstname, lastname, email, phone, jobtitle, country, city,
  lifecyclestage, hs_lead_status, hs_lead_status_label, lead_source,
  account_became_active, ct_account_status, active_trial,
  seats: { seat_range, seats_indicated__aggregated_, seats_requested_in_ft },
  engagement: { notes_last_contacted, num_contacted_notes },
  company: { name, domain },
  closedLostFlag, hygieneFlag,
  seat_tier, geo_tier, source_tier, rank_score }
```

### Regenerate each run

`refreshedAt`, `today`, `windowStart`, `windowEnd`, `funnel`, `items[]` (re-pulled, re-scored, re-sorted). `onboardingAlertCount` (3-30 day activation band) recomputes from `items`.

### PII handling

Same as module 02: names, emails, phones are present; local dashboard only; never logged, transmitted, or stored in memory.

---

## Module 06 - SDR Pacing

File: `src/modules/pacing/data.js`. Single export `PACING`. All counts via `/hs` GROUP BY across the full SDR roster.

### What it tracks

Current-month SQL and SQO actuals for every SDR in both offices (BCN + TOR), against per-person targets from `src/pacing.config.js`. The component renders progress bars, pace markers, status pills, and a month-over-month comparison tab.

### Pull discipline

Two `/hs` aggregations, one for SQL and one for SQO, grouped by `deal_creator__sdr_only_`:

**SQL actuals (current month):**
```
SELECT deal_creator__sdr_only_, SUM(amount_in_home_currency), COUNT(*)
FROM deals
WHERE deal_creator__sdr_only_ IN (<all roster owner IDs>)
  AND createdate BETWEEN <month_start> AND <now>
GROUP BY deal_creator__sdr_only_
```

**SQO actuals (current month):**
```
SELECT deal_creator__sdr_only_, SUM(amount_in_home_currency), COUNT(*)
FROM deals
WHERE deal_creator__sdr_only_ IN (<all roster owner IDs>)
  AND deal_accepted_by_ae = 'true'
  AND accepted_deal__date_time_ BETWEEN <month_start> AND <now>
GROUP BY deal_creator__sdr_only_
```

Both queries run in parallel. Owner IDs come from `pacing.config.js` roster, not hardcoded. Results are keyed by owner ID in the `actuals` object.

**Day-grain series (current month)** - two more aggregations, grouped by day instead of SDR, feeding the team tab's cumulative curve:

```
SELECT createdate, SUM(amount_in_home_currency)
FROM deals
WHERE deal_creator__sdr_only_ IN (<all roster owner IDs>)
  AND createdate BETWEEN <month_start> AND <now>
GROUP BY <day of createdate>
```

and the same shape on `accepted_deal__date_time_` with `deal_accepted_by_ae = 'true'`. If the connector's SQL cannot GROUP BY a date truncation, pull the per-deal rows (two columns only: date property + amount) and bucket by calendar day at payload-assembly time - the cohort filters stay identical to the per-SDR queries, so the totals must re-add to the same numbers. These run in the same parallel batch; same window, same cohorts.

### Payload assembly

1. Read `CURRENT_MONTH` from `src/pacing.config.js` for targets, roster, offices, pool.
2. For each roster entry, call `calFor(person, todayIso)` to get `{ total, elapsed, left }`.
3. Build the payload:

```js
{
  todayIso: "YYYY-MM-DD",
  monthLabel: "October",
  roster: [{ id, name, office, sql, sqo, cal: { total, elapsed, left }, note? }],
  actuals: { "<ownerId>": { sqlMrr, sqlDeals, sqoMrr, sqoDeals } },
  offices: { BCN: { label, region, workingDays }, TOR: { ... } },
  pool: { sql, sqo },
  daily: [{ date: "YYYY-MM-DD", sqlMrr, sqoMrr }]  // team totals per calendar day, non-cumulative
}
```

`daily` covers month start through today; days with nothing booked may be omitted (the UI treats a missing day as zero). The key is optional for backwards compatibility, but every refresh from 2026-10-06 onward must include it - omit it only with a declared dataGap.

4. Write to temp file, run `node scripts/gen-pacing.mjs <payload.json>`.

### Reconciliation

- Roster is non-empty.
- Every roster entry has `id`, `name`, `office`, `sql`, `sqo`, `cal`.
- Actuals keyed by owner ID.
- If `rollups.team` is present, team SQL/SQO must equal sum of individual actuals.
- If `daily` is present: every entry is `{ date: YYYY-MM-DD, sqlMrr: number, sqoMrr: number }`, and the series sums must equal the actuals sums (SQL and SQO each, within €0.01).

### Cadence

Full run only (09:00). Not on top-up runs - pacing numbers move once a day at most.

---

## Module 07 - Deals

File: `src/modules/deals/data.js`. Single export `DEALS`. Deal-level pull via `search_crm_objects`, enriched per deal. Config in `src/deals.config.js`.

### What it tracks

Every deal the operator created this calendar month, and what the AEs then did with it. The module is a four-column kanban by outcome - Upcoming, Awaiting decision, Accepted, Rejected - so the question it answers is not "how many demos" but "where is the month stuck".

### Cohort

One rule, deliberately wide: **every deal created in the current calendar month** where the operator is the creator.

- `deal_creator__sdr_only_` = `<ownerId>`
- `createdate` >= first day of the current month, 00:00 local

Note what is **not** in the cohort rule. There is no demo-date filter and no acceptance-grace exclusion. A deal with no demo booked is still a deal the operator created this month, and a deal accepted three weeks ago is still part of this month's accepted total. Both were excluded by the old demo-window cohort, which is why the old module could not total the month.

### Pull

Use `search_crm_objects` (not `query_crm_data`) because individual deal records are needed, not aggregates. Read `total`, paginate to it.

**Properties to request:**
`dealname`, `deal_creator__sdr_only_`, `demo_call__date_time_`, `hubspot_owner_id`, `amount_in_home_currency`, `deal_sdr_points_number`, `dealstage`, `createdate`, `deal_accepted_by_ae`, `accepted_deal__date_time_`, `rejected_deal_timestamp`, `deal_demo_no_show_status`

**Filter:**
```json
{

### Per-deal enrichment

For each deal returned:

1. **AE name** - `hubspot_owner_id` is the current owner (the AE after handoff). Resolve via `search_owners`. Unassigned -> `"Unassigned"`.
2. **Outcome** - the single field the kanban is built on, derived in this order:
   - `deal_accepted_by_ae = 'true'` -> `"accepted"`
   - `deal_accepted_by_ae = 'false'` -> `"rejected"`
   - no ruling, and `demo_call__date_time_` is in the future -> `"upcoming"`
   - otherwise -> `"pending"`
3. **Segment** - `segOf(amount_in_home_currency)` from `deals.config.js`: micro < 500, smb 500-1500, mm > 1500, none if null.
4. **No-show status** - `noShowState(deal_demo_no_show_status)`: "ok", "noshow", or "rescheduled". Note the property is `deal_demo_no_show_status`, not `demo_no_show_status`.
5. **Age** - `ageH`, hours on the clock the deal is racing. **The clock starts at the demo**, because the SLA is on the AE, not on the SDR: `demoAt` if set, else `created`. A deal with no demo ages from creation, which is the correct read - nothing is going to move it without a booking.
6. **Points** - `deal_sdr_points_number`, 0 if null. These are what commission actually pays on.

Breach is **not** a payload field. `ageH > slaHours` on a `pending` deal is derived in the generator and again in the component. A stored `breaching` flag is a second source of truth that goes wrong the moment the clock moves past it.

### Payload shape

```js
{
  todayIso: "YYYY-MM-DD",
  monthLabel: "October 2026",
  monthStart: "2026-10-01",
  slaHours: 48,              // deals.config.js SLA_HOURS
  target: 12000,             // deals.config.js MONTHLY_TARGET_EUR - a run-rate line, not a quota
  pointsQuota: 90,           // deals.config.js POINTS_QUOTA
  deals: [{
    id: "<dealId>",
    name: "<dealname>",
    ae: "Name",
    amt: 1200,                 // amount_in_home_currency (EUR)
    pts: 3,                    // deal_sdr_points_number
    seg: "micro" | "smb" | "mm" | "none",
    ns: "ok" | "noshow" | "rescheduled",
    outcome: "upcoming" | "pending" | "accepted" | "rejected",
    created: "<ISO>",
    demoAt: "<ISO>" | null,
    ageH: 31.5,                // hours since demoAt, else since created
    decidedAt: "<ISO>" | null, // accepted_deal__date_time_ or rejected_deal_timestamp
    country: "ES" | null
  }],
  dataGaps: ["<string>"]       // declared misses; rendered verbatim by the module
}
```

`decidedAt` and `country` are carried but not yet rendered. They are cheap to pull in the same request and the alternative - discovering mid-build that the ruling timestamp was never captured - costs a whole re-pull. Keep populating them.

Write to temp file, run `node scripts/gen-deals.mjs <payload.json>`.

### Reconciliation

- `DEALS` has `todayIso`, `monthLabel`, `monthStart`, `slaHours`, `target`, `pointsQuota`, `deals`.
- `slaHours` is a positive number.
- Every deal has required keys: `id`, `name`, `ae`, `amt`, `pts`, `seg`, `ns`, `outcome`, `created`, `demoAt`, `ageH`.
- Valid `seg`: micro, smb, mm, none. Valid `ns`: ok, noshow, rescheduled. Valid `outcome`: upcoming, pending, accepted, rejected.
- **`outcome: "upcoming"` requires a non-null `demoAt`.** A deal is upcoming *because* a demo is booked in the future. Without one the classification is unprovable, so the generator throws rather than let the column fill with deals that merely have no outcome yet.

### Cadence

Full run only (09:00). Not on top-up runs - AE rulings do not land at a frequency that justifies re-pulling five times a day, and the 48h SLA clock is derived at render time from `created`/`demoAt`, so the breach count stays correct between refreshes without a re-pull.

### PII handling

`deals[].name` is a deal name (company) and `deals[].ae` is a colleague, not a prospect. No personal contact data in the payload. Safe from a PII standpoint, but `data.js` is still gitignored as a matter of policy.

---

## Validation gate (every module, every run)

Before writing `data.js`:

1. **Parse** the generated module to confirm it is valid JS (the file must `export` cleanly).
2. **Shape check** - required keys present, arrays non-degenerate, no `undefined`/`NaN` in numeric fields.
3. **Reconciliation** - module 04/05 totals must equal the sum of their parts (e.g. funnel SQL = sum of seat-tier SQL; `eligible` = `noDeal` + `closedLostReengage`). A mismatch means a client-side count slipped in - re-pull via `/hs`.

Steps 1-3 are enforced by `scripts/lib/refresh-core.mjs`, not by judgement - the generator throws rather than writing a payload that fails any of them.

After writing, reload the preview and confirm no Vite error overlay and no console errors. Start it with `preview_start` (name `may4-briefing`) and use whatever serverId that returns - never a hardcoded one, the id changes every restart. In an unattended run the preview check is best-effort: the generator's re-import already proves the file parses.

## Freshness stamp

`runGenerator` writes `export const GENERATED_AT = "<ISO>"` into every `data.js`, taken from the write itself rather than the payload, so it cannot drift or be forgotten. `src/lib/freshness.js` reads it and the Shell banners any module not refreshed today. Nothing in a payload should carry this value.

## Reversibility

`runGenerator` backs each `data.js` up before overwriting, writes to a temp file, renames atomically, re-imports to prove the module parses and exports what it should, then runs reconciliation. On any failure it restores the backup and throws; the backup is deleted only on success. An unattended failure therefore leaves the previous day's data fully intact - never a half-write. Report the failure and stop; do not retry blindly or hand-patch `data.js`.
